# Stage one

- Generated new Rails application starwarsapi. Decided to add HTTParty as a dependency for easier api calls
- Created Services folder. Created swapi_service
- Generated films controller and set root to "films#index"
- Learning how to interact with swapi. Pulled all data from swapi and used an each loop to display each film title in an array on the home page
